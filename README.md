# Tableau-Crimes-in-Denver

In this project done with Tableau, we analyze crime in the Denver metro area to aid in crime prevention. The analysis includes visualizations and insights aimed at identifying patterns and trends, helping the Denver Police Department to improve community safety. 

Previously, data cleaning was conducted in Excel to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.
